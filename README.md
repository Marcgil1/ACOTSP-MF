Abstract:
Ant Colony Optimization (ACO) is a population-based meta-heuristic inspired by the social behavior of ants.
It is successfully applied in solving many NP-hard problems, such as the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP).
Large-sized instances pose two memory problems to the ACOTSP algorithm: the memory size and the memory
bandwidth.
This work has focused on developing ACOTSP-MF, a new ACOTSP algorithm proposed to adequately
manage the memory issues that arise while solving large TSP instances. ACOTSP-MF uses the nearest neighbor
list, introducing a novel class of cities, the backup cities, while grouping cities into three classes: the nearest
neighbor cities, the backup cities, and the rest of the cities (the majority). ACOTSP-MF also modifies how the
base ACOTSP carries out the tour construction and pheromone update phases depending on the group to which a
city belongs. This way, ACOTSP-MF reduces both the memory requirements of its data structures (from ùëÇ(ùëõ ‚àó ùëõ)
to ùëÇ(ùëõ)), and the memory bandwidth needs (thanks to better exploitation of the memory data locality).
In this paper, we have carried out an in-depth analysis of ACOTSP-MF performance for medium and large
TSP instances, covering vectorization and scalability issues and showing its main bottlenecks. For medium-size
instances, the paper reports speedup factors of 20-500X for the rl11849 instance compared to the base
ACOTSP version. ACOTSP-MF is intended and especially adequate for large-size instances. In this context, the
paper reports excellent execution time for the Tour Construction phase, with less than 500 ms per iteration for
the earring-200k instance. Finally, a study about the solution quality of ACOTSP-MF has been included,
showing that ACOTSP-MF paired with local search offers high solution quality (within 2% of the best-known
solution).
